This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
## you need to read this first:
There are a total of five pages:

main_blog: Displays all blogs in a grid format. Clicking on a blog routes you to blog[-slug-].
blog[]: Dynamically displays the selected blog.
showupdate: Shows a table with edit and delete actions. Clicking "edit" routes you to t[-slug-].
t[]: Provides admin mode for the selected blog.
adm: An admin panel used for inserting blogs.
I am using MongoDB as the database.
Also i hve use jodit for rich text editing.
Initially, the projectâ€™s performance was not very good, with a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of 3.8s. However, after some adjustments, I have improved it to 1.26s.

I am using Multer for storing image.

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

Currently, there is no authentication, so you need to manually navigate to:

Edit a blog: http://localhost:3000/showupdate
Insert a blog: http://localhost:3000/showupdate/adm

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
